<div class="pz_note" id="lagrange_geom_note">
This is the justification for drawing the Lagange sensing basis as orthogonal
in a three dimensional plot, with the coordinates as the sample values.
</div>

<div class="pz_note" id="lagrange_norm_note">
Lagrange polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the inner product
$$
(f(t),g(t))=\sum_k f(t_k) g(t_k) 
$$  
</div>

<div class="pz_note" id="projection_sum_note">
The coordinate plane we are projecting onto is defined by two sensing 
basis signals. Projecting onto the plane is the same as projecting into
each sensing basis signal, one at a time, then adding the results
</div>

<div class="pz_note" id="sine_basis_note">
$\mathcal{B}_F$ is a basis of trigonometric polynomials in the sense that
$$
\sin(n\theta)=\imag{x^n}
$$
with $x=e^{j\theta}$.
